# Reflections Log

This document serves as a log of reflections on various topics, capturing insights, lessons learned, and personal growth. It is intended to help users track their thoughts and experiences over time.

## Reflection
Based on my analysis of the code generated by GPT-5, I have found that the AI is fairly capable of generating Java code of consistent style that follows all naming conventions and user requests. Having only edited the package reference in the testing files, all files seemingly functioned as expected and gave an accurate output.

There are some issues the IDE picked up in GPT's code: most prominently in the testing files, where it consistently imports a redundant package class, but I believe that could be due to a miscommunication of the project's file structure rather than the AI making a mistake. Any other issues that were flagged by the IDE seem to come down to convention rather than functionality.

I purposefully avoided manually editing as much of the generated code as I could, as I wanted to see if the code GPT generated would run as expected, which it did successfully on the first try.

### Mathematical Verification
To verify all mathematical formula calculations, I utilized Google's shape calculators to run the calculations myself with the values GPT generated. In all cases, the answers of the calculations in the generated code were equal to the calculations done with Google's calculators. 

### Code Quality Review
In order to review GPT's code's quality, I attempted to create unique shapes (via the interactive features provided in ShapeDriver.java) using negative numbers, as that is the only form of error handling GPT embedded into the shapes classes. The error was handled appropriately, but if I were to go in and edit anything, I would definitely refine the handling process (for example, in its current state, the code recognizes that a negative number is invalid but still prints the shape information without waiting for a correct response. I would refine this so that the code waits for a correct response before adding the shape and printing the new information).

No other errors are handled. If the user were to enter a non-integer value, the program would throw an exception and exit. Of course, if I were to turn this in for an assignment based on its functionality, I would ensure that all possible errors are handled appropriately.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, I am thoroughly impressed by how effective ChatGPT was for generating this project. However, the code definitely needs some refining in its current state. It is clear that AI tools cannot be entirely depended upon when it comes to generating entire projects, assuming that you want polished code. However, it seems to provide a great starting point to work off of.
